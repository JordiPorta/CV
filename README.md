# CV

My curriculum is focused on the IT companies, but, in this case, of the teacher's of multimedia. We can find some description of myself along with my profile picture within my curriculum. We can also find some sections about my knowledge and competences together with some fake experience. I have chosen three colors, black, white and orange, because I think it has an attractive sight for the visitors.
